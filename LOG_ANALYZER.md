# Log Analyzer

The Log Analyzer parses uploaded **mongosync** log and metrics files offline and builds interactive charts, tables, and searchable log views. Open it from the hub (**Log analyzer** → **Open log analyzer**) or go directly to `/logs/`.

## Upload a file

On the Log analyzer home page, use **Parse Mongosync Files** to select a log and/or metrics file and click **Upload**. A successful parse opens the results page with one or more analysis tabs (Summary first when log lines are present, then charts, metrics, options, and more depending on file content).

### Supported formats

| Type | Extensions |
|------|------------|
| Uncompressed logs | `.log`, `.json`, `.out` |
| Compressed archives | `.gz`, `.zip`, `.bz2`, `.tgz`, `.tar.gz`, `.tar.bz2` |

Maximum upload size defaults to **10 GB** (`MI_MAX_FILE_SIZE`).

### What gets parsed

Migration Insights detects two kinds of content in the uploaded file:

1. **Structured mongosync JSON log lines** — the main migration log (`mongosync.log` or rotated segments). These drive the **Summary**, **Mongosync Logs**, **Errors and Warnings**, and **Log Viewer** tabs.
2. **Prometheus metrics lines** — from `mongosync_metrics.log`. These drive the **Mongosync Metrics** tab.

A single upload can contain log lines only, metrics only, or both. Tabs appear based on what was found.

### Filename recognition

Uploads are classified by **substring** in the filename (basename, case-insensitive). Compression suffixes (`.gz`, `.bz2`, `.zip`) are stripped before matching.

| Type | Filename must contain |
|------|------------------------|
| Metrics | `metrics` |
| Log | `mongosync` or `liveimport` |

If the name contains both `metrics` and `mongosync`, it is treated as a **metrics** file.

Files that do not match either rule are rejected with an **Unrecognized File** error. For `.zip` / `.tar` archives, each inner file is classified the same way; unrecognized members are skipped. If the archive contains no recognizable log or metrics files, the upload is rejected.

Examples: `mongosync_metrics_22JUN2026.log` → metrics; `mongosync.log.1` → log; `myfile.log` → rejected.

### Log verbosity

Charts and panels depend on the **verbosity level** mongosync used when the log was captured. For full chart coverage (including partition init duration/count), capture logs with at least `--verbosity 1`:

```bash
mongosync --cluster0 "..." --cluster1 "..." --verbosity 1
```

See **[LOG_VERBOSITY.md](LOG_VERBOSITY.md)** for a complete chart-to-verbosity mapping.

## Analysis results tabs

After parsing, the results page shows one or more tabs:

| Tab | When shown | Purpose |
|-----|------------|---------|
| **Summary** | Log lines found | Snapshot of the latest migration state, using the same cards as Migration Monitoring |
| **Mongosync Logs** | Log lines found | Time-series charts: phases, lag, copy progress, CEA, indexes, verifier, etc. |
| **Mongosync Metrics** | Prometheus metrics found | Charts from `mongosync_metrics.json` (OTel/Prometheus exposition in log lines) |
| **Mongosync Options** | Log lines found | Version info, startup options, hidden flags, `/api/v1/start` request body |
| **Collections and Partitions** | Log lines found | Natural-order collections and per-collection partition tables |
| **CEA Busiest Collections** | CEA CRUD statistics found in log | Per-namespace CEA write rankings, time-series chart, and workload warnings |
| **Errors and Warnings** | Log lines found | Pattern-matched errors with optional recommendations |
| **Log Viewer** | Log lines found | Tail view and full-text search over indexed log lines |

### Summary

The Summary tab reuses the Migration Monitoring layout (state badge, copy progress, lag, index building, direction mapping, embedded verifier, filters) but is **not live**. Values come from:

1. The **latest `/api/v1/progress` body** recorded in `sent response` log lines (primary source for state, copy bytes, lag, canCommit/canWrite, index building, verifier, direction).
2. **Other log events** already used for charts and tables: phase transitions, `/api/v1/start` options, natural-order collections, and partition copy counts.

The subtitle shows the timestamp of that latest `/progress` line so it is clear the page is a snapshot from the uploaded file.

### Mongosync Logs

Interactive Plotly charts grouped by section (global migration, collection copy, CEA, indexes, verifier). Zoom, pan, and toggle series from the legend. The **Mongosync Progress** table includes a **Copy as Markdown** badge on the chart for sharing phase and state-transition rows.

### Mongosync Metrics

Separate dashboard for OTEL metrics embedded in metrics log files (rates, counters, histograms configured in `lib/mongosync_metrics.json`).

![Log Analyzer - Mongosync Metrics](images/mongosync_logs_metrics.png)

### Mongosync Options

Read-only tables for:

- **Mongosync Options** — flags logged at startup
- **Mongosync Hidden Options** — internal/hidden flags
- **Mongosync Start Options** — JSON body from the `/api/v1/start` request

> **Note:** Startup options appear only in the **first** log segment after mongosync starts. If you upload a rotated or partial file from mid-migration, these panels may be empty — use the earlier rotated file or the segment that contains startup/start.

![Log Analyzer - Mongosync Options](images/mongosync_logs_options.png)

### Collections and Partitions

- **Collections Copied in Natural Order** — namespaces selected for natural-order reads
- **Collection Partitions** — per-collection partition progress tables (searchable, exportable as Markdown)

![Log Analyzer - Collections and Partitions](images/mongosync_logs_collections_partitions.png)

### CEA Busiest Collections

Shown when the uploaded log contains mongosync **CEA (change event application)** CRUD statistics.

- **Time-series chart** — top namespaces by write volume per 10-second interval
- **Namespace write activity table** — cumulative write ops by type (insert, update, delete, replace, etc.), sortable and searchable, with **Copy as Markdown**
- **CEA workload warnings** — hot-document and `$out` aggregation warnings with spread disparity; **View in Log Viewer** jumps to that namespace

> **Note:** Mongosync logs only the **top 20** busiest collections per 10-second interval. Totals are approximate and may under-count namespaces that were never in that window. The tab requires log segments that include CEA at default `info` verbosity.

![Log Analyzer - Busiest Collections](images/mongosync_logs_busiest_collections.png)

### Errors and Warnings

Log lines matched against **`error_patterns.json`** (or a custom file via `MI_ERROR_PATTERNS_FILE`). Each match shows a friendly name, the log excerpt, timestamp, and an optional **recommendation** for common failure modes (oplog rollover, duplicate key, index conflicts, CEA failures, etc.).

Filter the table with the search box or **Copy as Markdown** for sharing.

![Errors and Warnings tab](images/mongosync_logs_errors.png)

### Log Viewer

Indexed log lines are stored in a SQLite **log store** for fast search without re-uploading.

- **Tail** — last N lines (default **2000**, `MI_LOG_VIEWER_MAX_LINES`)
- **Search** — full-text search with level filter and pagination
- **Date/time range** — **From** / **To** datetime filters (searched as entered, matching log `time` values); can be used alone or combined with text search across the full indexed log store
- **Focus** — quick filters for errors, warnings, or custom text
- **Download** — export the tail buffer as a `.log` file

![Log Viewer tab](images/mongosync_logs_logviewer.png)

## Previous analyses (snapshots)

Each successful parse saves an **analysis snapshot** on disk (JSON + metadata) and registers a SQLite log store. The Log analyzer home page lists **Previous Analyses** with filename, date, size, and age.

From the results page sidebar you can also browse, load, or delete saved analyses.

### Duplicate upload

If you upload a file that matches an existing saved analysis (same filename), MI prompts you to:

- **Load Previous** — open the saved snapshot (no re-parse)
- **Replace** — delete the old snapshot and parse again
- **Cancel** — abort the upload

### Snapshot retention

By default, snapshots and log stores live under the system temp directory and expire after **24 hours** (`MI_LOG_STORE_MAX_AGE_HOURS`). Set a persistent directory for longer retention:

```bash
export MI_LOG_STORE_DIR=/data/migration-insights/store
export MI_LOG_STORE_MAX_AGE_HOURS=48
```

Expired snapshots (older than `MI_LOG_STORE_MAX_AGE_HOURS` by file modification time) are deleted during app startup and logout maintenance, and hidden from the **Previous Analyses** list once expired. Loading a snapshot resets the modification time on the snapshot files and companion log store, extending on-disk retention for another TTL period. The in-memory log store registry tracks registration time (`created_at`) separately; loading a snapshot does not reset that clock.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Log Analyzer use |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| `MI_MAX_FILE_SIZE` | `10737418240` (10 GB) | Max upload size |
| `MI_ERROR_PATTERNS_FILE` | `lib/error_patterns.json` | Custom error pattern definitions |
| `MI_LOG_STORE_DIR` | OS temp | Snapshot and log-store directory |
| `MI_LOG_STORE_MAX_AGE_HOURS` | `24` | Snapshot/log-store TTL |
| `MI_LOG_VIEWER_MAX_LINES` | `2000` | Tail view line limit |

See **[CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md)** for examples (upload size, persistent snapshots, log viewer buffer).

## Log analyzer vs Migration Monitoring

| | Log Analyzer | Migration Monitoring |
|---|--------------|----------------------|
| **Input** | Upload log/metrics files | Live connection string and/or progress endpoint |
| **Timing** | Post-hoc / historical (Summary tab is a snapshot of the latest `/progress` in the log) | Real-time polling |
| **Best for** | Deep dive on completed or in-progress runs from logs | Live dashboard while mongosync is running |

Use both when troubleshooting: Migration Monitoring for current state, Log Analyzer for historical trends and full log search.

See **[MIGRATION_MONITORING.md](MIGRATION_MONITORING.md)** for the live dashboard.
